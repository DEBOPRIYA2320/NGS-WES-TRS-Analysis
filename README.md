# üìë Project Report

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has transformed genomics by enabling fast, cost-effective sequencing of DNA and RNA. Among NGS approaches, **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)** and **Targeted Region Sequencing (TRS)** are powerful methods for identifying variants within coding or specific genomic regions.  
This project focuses on the **bioinformatics workflow for WES/TRS**, outlining key computational steps and tools used for transforming raw sequencing reads into biologically meaningful variant annotations.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Objectives
- To perform quality assessment and preprocessing of NGS reads.  
- To align reads to a reference genome and generate BAM files.  
- To identify variants (SNPs and indels) using GATK and SAMtools.  
- To annotate variants using SnpEff and interpret their biological significance.  
- To compare workflows and outputs for WGS, WES, and TRS data.

### Tools and Software Used
| Step | Tool | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Quality Check | **FastQC** | Evaluate raw sequence quality |
| Trimming | **Trim Galore** | Remove low-quality bases and adapters |
| Alignment | **BWA** | Map reads to reference genome |
| Post-Processing | **SAMtools** | Sort, index, and manage BAM files |
| Variant Calling | **GATK HaplotypeCaller** | Identify SNPs and indels |
| Annotation | **SnpEff** | Predict variant effects on genes/proteins |

### Workflow Overview
1. **Input Data:** Raw paired-end FASTQ files  
2. **Quality Control:** Evaluate read quality using FastQC  
3. **Read Trimming:** Remove adapters and low-quality sequences  
4. **Alignment:** Map reads to reference genome using BWA  
5. **Sorting & Indexing:** Organize and index BAM files  
6. **Variant Calling:** Detect genomic variants using GATK  
7. **Annotation:** Use SnpEff to classify and interpret variant impacts

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Results and Discussion
- High-quality reads were confirmed using FastQC before and after trimming.  
- Alignment achieved high mapping efficiency with minimal read loss.  
- Variant calling identified SNPs and small indels within targeted regions.  
- SnpEff annotation provided functional classification of variants (e.g., synonymous, missense, nonsense).  
- The workflow effectively demonstrates how **bioinformatics pipelines** translate raw NGS data into meaningful genomic insights.
